# CodeKataBattle Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Software Engineering 2 course for the academic year 2023-2024. It focuses on applying software engineering practices to develop a platform that helps students improve their software development skills through competitive programming exercises. The project includes two assignments:
1. The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for the given specification
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- `RASD/`: Contains the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document and related diagrams/files
- `DD/`: Contains the Design Document and related diagrams/files
- `DeliveryFolder/`: Contains the final PDF versions of RASD and DD

## Microservices Approach

The design of CodeKataBattle uses a microservices architecture. Each core functionality of the platform (e.g., user management, battle management, scoring system) is implemented as a separate microservice, which communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This approach ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
