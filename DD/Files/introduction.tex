\subsection{Scope}
Traditional software programming education often lacks of hands-on experience and continuous evaluation. CodeKataBattle addresses these issues by providing a platform for competitive programming challenges which promotes teamwork and emphasizes the test-first approach in software development. It allows students to apply theoretical knowledge in tournaments with an automated scoring system. Instructors benefit from closer mentorship through code reviews and manual evaluation, creating a cycle of learning through practice, feedback, and community engagement.
